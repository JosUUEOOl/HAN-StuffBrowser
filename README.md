### Troubleshooting

- The mod doesn't show on the XMB

Make sure you have **the lastest support** files [(Official Link)](http://ps3xploit.com/files/release/ps3_tools-v3.0-HAN481+_release_PS3XPloit.zip)

- Error code **80023300** when trying download 

The DB **Content ID** info doesn't match with file Content ID (Report this error)

- After downloading a PS1/MINIS package a "Please Wait..." message appears and don't install the package

Check "★ Package Manager > PlayStation Network Content" to see downloaded packages from that category

- Downloads are very slow

Use Ethernet connection instead WIFI. **To use all your network speed use a local proxy and set it up on your PS3**
